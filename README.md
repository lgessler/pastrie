## Overview
PASTRIE is a corpus of English data from Reddit annotated with preposition supersenses from the [SNACS inventory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02134).

While the data in PASTRIE is in English, it was produced by presumed speakers of four L1s:
- English
- French
- German
- Spanish

For details on how L1s were identified, see section 3.1 of [Rabinovich et al. (2018)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q18-1024.pdf).

### Annotation Example
Below is an example sentence from the corpus, where annotation targets are bolded and preposition supersenses are annotated with the notation SceneRole‚ÜùFunction. Together, a scene role and function are known as a [construal](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S17-1022.pdf).
